            <h2>OUR DEBUT</h2>
            <p>To our fans: We had all of you in mind when it comes to this album. After 2 mini-albums, we decided it was time to bring in a fresh vibe. Think soft beats, soothing vocals and lyrics that might hit a little close to home (but it's okay).</p>

            <h2>PERFECT FOR...</h2>
            <p>This album is perfect for unwinding, journaling or those late-night confessions. The album was inspired by those quiet moments when the entire world slows down. </p>
